Password Generator

This is a simple encrypted string generator written in Ruby that may be suitable
for creating passwords, depending on your security requirements.

Run password-generator.rb if you have Ruby installed, or password-generator.exe
if you are on Windows and do not have Ruby installed.

If you need special or specific characters in the resulting password, include
them in the 2 character salt. (e.g. !8 as salt will make !8 the first two
characters of the resulting string).
